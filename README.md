The architecture includes:
- **Flask backend** for processing detection results.
- **Streamlit dashboard** for a real-time user-friendly interface for both administrators and drivers.
- **MongoDB** for storing parking data, enabling occupancy tracking, usage analysis, and future optimizations.

Planned enhancements include:
- **Cloud integration** for distributed scalability.
- **Predictive analytics** for demand forecasting.
- **Mobile-based reservations** and **automated billing**.

By reducing search time, minimizing congestion, and optimizing parking utilization, the system contributes to sustainable and intelligent urban mobility, aligning with smart city visions.
